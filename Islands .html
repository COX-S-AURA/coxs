<h1>Discover the natural beauty and cultural diversity of Bangladesh's coastal islands</h1>
<div style="padding:16px">
<h2>St. Martin's Island</h2>
<p>St. Martin's Island is the only coral island in Bangladesh, and one of the most popular destinations for tourists. It is located about 9 km south of the mainland, and can be reached by boat from Teknaf. The island is small, only about 8 sq km, but it has a lot to offer. You can enjoy the crystal clear water, the coral reefs, the coconut groves, and the local seafood. You can also visit the neighboring Chera Dwip, a smaller island that is connected to St. Martin's by a sandbar during low tide. St. Martin's Island is a great place to relax and enjoy nature, but be aware that there is no electricity or fresh water on the island, so you will need to bring your own supplies or stay at a local guesthouse.</p>

<h2>Sonadia Island</h2>
<p>Sonadia Island is a large island, about 9 km long and 6 km wide, located near the mouth of the Bakkhali River. It is known for its mangrove forests, salt fields, and diverse wildlife. The island is home to many migratory birds, such as flamingos, herons, and ducks, as well as endangered species like the Irrawaddy dolphin and the olive ridley turtle. You can explore the island by boat, bicycle, or foot, and observe the local fishing and salt-making activities. You can also visit the nearby Moheshkhali Island, which has a famous Hindu temple dedicated to the goddess Shakti.</p>

<h2>Nijhum Dwip</h2>
<p>Nijhum Dwip, or the Island of Silence, is a remote and tranquil island in the Bay of Bengal. It is part of the Noakhali district, and can be reached by boat from Hatiya or Sandwip. The island is about 16 km long and 10 km wide, and consists of several smaller islands that are separated by creeks. The island is mostly covered by forest, and is a sanctuary for deer, monkeys, and birds. You can enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, the green scenery, and the sandy beaches of the island, and also visit the local villages and markets. Nijhum Dwip is a perfect place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, and experience the rural life of Bangladesh.</p>
